hyperspace:
 - duration 10+10/LY+10 seconds
 - fuel use proportional to dist^0.5 (so longer jumps use less fuel than two short ones but are more difficult to do)
 - requires matching of pitch/roll to a particular pattern specific to the jump+direction
 -- jumping out of interstellar gets a random pattern
 - drains energy during jump, faster with poor matching, slower with good matching (particularly good matching can allow ERR to regenerate energy)
 - running out of energy causes ship destruction as usual; can force a misjump at the current fraction to avoid this
 -- (failure in first ten is unlikely, but causes jump initiation to fail)
 -- (failure in last ten drops out in target system but badly placed)
 - all misjumps cause damage to ship - more if energy was especially low when done
 - once jump has been done successfully once, energy cost is reduced
 - after a number of successful jumps, pattern confidence increases. Once above a threshold secondary exit points can be used for gravity-scanned bodies 
 - primary exit point is near star.

ship:
 - generator, ANA, ASC, STE, TSME, ITS as standard
 - ten modules can be fitted
 -- fuel tank 
 -- capacitor 
 -- sample collection bay (20 samples per bay)
 -- retrieval bay (remote module bays become this when launched)
 -- remote modules:
 --- gravitic satellite
 --- stellar observation satellite
 --- weather satellite
 --- survey control satellite
 --- astronomic survey satellite
 --- atmospheric probe
 --- asteroid miner
 --- planetary rover
 --- solar plane
 --- planetary boat
 --- surface sample retrieval lander
 -- installation components (also become retrieval bay when used)
 --- backbone
 --- fuel tank
 --- fuel transfer system
 --- fuel refinery
 --- raw material store
 --- solar panel
 -- sensor packages:
 --- gravitic
 --- spectroscopic
 --- radar
 --- infrared
 --- parallax
 - one weapon can be fitted (also handled as a module)
 -- prospecting laser
 -- sampling laser
 - No shields - repair value is integrity, when gets to zero further damage hits systems

Default equipment:
 - fuel tank*3
 - capacitor*3
 - prospecting laser
 - gravitic sensor
 - spectroscopic sensor
 - gravitic satellite
