The setting is similar in some ways to the original Oolite setting, but provides more detail in the politics, economy and history of the region, and is of a set of charts which have been inhabited for less time - many systems are still unsettled or only lightly populated.

Also experimented with are NPC torus drives and ship-to-ship docking.";
